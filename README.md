# Anomaly Detection  

This project explores anomaly detection techniques for identifying unusual patterns in data.

## Techniques and Highlights  
- Time series feature engineering to capture trends and variability  
- Anomaly detection using clustering-based methods with Silhouette score evaluation  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) to improve detection performance and interpretability  
- Clever data visualizations to overlay detected anomalies on original time series  
- Interactive dashboards built using **Dash** for dynamic exploration of results  

## Libraries / Tech Stack  
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- Dash
